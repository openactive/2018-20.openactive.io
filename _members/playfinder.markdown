Playfinderâ€™s partners include the largest operators of sports venues in the UK, including GLL, PowerLeague, Fusion Lifestyle and EveryoneActive. They also work with independent venues, schools, councils and trusts to help increase the usage of their facilities and make it easier for players to discover, book and play.
