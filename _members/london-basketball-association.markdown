London Basketball Association is a registered charity, established in July 2012. We are a small but intensely committed organisation, built up and employing directly from the very communities within which we work. We operate within the ‘sport for development’ sector and aim to bring positive social change in areas such as health and wellbeing, substance misuse and employment, through the powerful medium of sport, and basketball specifically.
