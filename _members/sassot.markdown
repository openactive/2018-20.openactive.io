SASSOT (Sport Across Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent) is the Active Partnership for the Staffordshire sub-region. We are a network of local agencies committed to working together
to increase the number of people taking part in physical activity and sport, and are part of an England-wide network of 43 Active Partnerships. We have a vision to get Everyone More Active More Often and we deliver a range of services and programmes to achieve this, focusing on the key themes of People, Place, Economy and System.
