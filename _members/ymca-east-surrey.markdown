YMCA East Surrey is a vibrant, local charity that offers a wide range of wholly inclusive, local services from sport, physical activity, play and childcare to counselling, youth work, supported housing and volunteering.We help people to believe in themselves, support them to achieve their goals and inspire them to be the best they can be by providing services that focus on those who are vulnerable, have a disability or face disadvantage.
