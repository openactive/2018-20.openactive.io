The London Fitness Tour is a new way to stay fit and active in London by exploring its culture, music and history. We organise sessions that last from 45 minutes during lunch breaks to a couple of hours at weekend where we power walk and exercise across parks, rooftop gardens, city farms, tunnels, street art, temples and much more to stimulate the brain and exercise without realising.
