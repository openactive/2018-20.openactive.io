Everyone Active is part of Sports and Leisure Management Ltd, the longest-established leisure contractor in the UK, having been founded in 1987. We make it our mission to encourage everyone to participate in at least 30 minutes of activity, either in one of our centres or via online training, five times per week. We manage over 190 leisure facilities across England in partnership with more than 60 local authorities. We are passionate about being active and want our members to be too. Whether it is state-of-the art gym equipment, excellent sports facilities, Swim England-accredited swimming programmes or activities for children, our centres offer something for everyone.
