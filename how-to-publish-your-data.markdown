<div class="one">

Your published data must be licensed for anyone to access, use and share. The Open Data Institute recommends the [Creative Commons Attribution Licence (cc-by) version 4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

If you **do not** own the data (e.g. in the case of a booking system provider), then you need to ensure that you obtain permission to publish the data.

You need to amend your terms and conditions to indicate that your users' sessions will be published openly. You may also give your users an option to opt-out of session publishing, while sending them an e-mail notifying them that you are turning data sharing on.

A simple addition to your Terms and Conditions similar to the following:

> **Publishing Sessions Openly**
> Information about your session that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) will be published as open data for anyone to access, use and share, licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution License (cc-by) version 4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This gives your sessions more visibility by publishing them openly to apps and websites that will help you promote your sessions, including but not limited to those listed [here](https://www.openactive.io/pioneers.html). This will help more people find your sessions, and will not incur any additional cost to you. [You may opt-out of this free service in your settings page.\]

A simple opt-out checkbox visible in your application as below:

> **Publish Sessions Openly**
> Information about your sessions that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) is published for anyone to access, use and share. This helps more people find your sessions, by making them visible on other apps and websites such as the ones listed [here](https://www.openactive.io/pioneers.html). This does not incur any additional cost to you.

A simple e-mail alert similar to the following:

> **Publishing Sessions Openly**
> We are now giving your sessions more visibility by publishing information about them that is already available publicly (e.g. title, location, description, date/time, price, images) openly to [apps and websites that will help you promote your sessions](https://www.openactive.io/pioneers.html), such as the ones listed [here](https://www.openactive.io/pioneers.html). This will help more people find your sessions, and will not incur any additional cost to you. If you want to opt-out of this free service, [go to your settings page](https://www.openactive.io/technology.html#).
