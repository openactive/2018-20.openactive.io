OpenActive Champions assemble: 10 advocates embrace local transformation with open data to get people active

The OpenActive Champions programme launches this month, uniting ten advocates working to locally transform their part of the sport and physical activity sector with open data.

The OpenActive Champions programme is a peer-network supporting ten advocates in the sport and physical activity sector responsible for driving physical activity locally. From Yorkshire to Sussex each champion is at various stages of their open data journey ready to progress change.

Local efforts for nationwide change
Increasing physical activity is complex. People face various barriers when becoming and staying active, which changes dramatically across England. Some places have high levels of unemployment, activities across sparse rural areas, high health-related issues, a lack of digital infrastructure, diverse communities, saturated markets and seasonal challenges.

OpenActive Champions make it possible for open data to play a part in responding effectively to these complexities.


### A vision made for champions

Collectively, supporting their own remit of work, the OpenActive Champions embrace and influence transformation with open opportunity data. They are committed to develop local knowledge, share good practice and drive innovation. Learning from their collective experience they will champion open data to help people get active across England and support the wider initiative.

### The Open Data Institute’s support

Mandy Costello, OpenActive’s Head of Data Literacy at the Open Data Institute said,

> “At the ODI we aim to support the champions to progress their vision by connecting them to experts and together develop practical solutions, skills and approaches to amplify their transformative work in their local area. We welcome the champions as they embark on an exciting journey with open data and will support them along the way.”

The ODI will support the champions to identify how open data can support their individual aims within their existing organisational roles. Their work as champions aims to amplify their existing work in the sector where open data can benefit.

The champions mark a beginning of geographical focus across the initiative and the ODI encourages others to get in touch if interested in progressing open data in their locality as an OpenActive member.
