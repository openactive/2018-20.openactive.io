    "text": "Among a flurry of activity in the lead up to Christmas, we were working hard to update the overall OpenActive brand and rebuild the website. Read what we’ve been up to so far and how you can help us test the website prototype. As I wrote in a previous post, the current website had started to become limiting as the initiative has grown throughout Phase 1 and we’ve developed ways to better support the community. Redeveloping the website is an important activity that will support the different streams across OpenActive — from better explaining our vision and progress, nesting a home for new developer resources, the forthcoming startup accelerator, online training and tools, community events, and more. In this post I’d like to share some of the process we’ve taken, and progress we’ve made. What’s been done We undertook some initial discovery work between September and October, followed by a tender process to find a UX/design/development partner. Thrilled with the 10 proposals received, we scored each against a set of criteria and shortlisted two finalists. It was a hard slog. Both were very strong responses and we had confidence they could work with us to create something great. Following much debate and scrutinisation we appointed design agency Imaginate, who came with a wealth of industry experience alongside strong design, technical skills and open working values. Since then, Imaginate have been working with the ODI’s OpenActive team on: Creating a new brand, logo and style guide Undertaking UX (user experience) work to translate user needs into a structure and content for the site in the form of a prototype Developing the underlying foundations for what will become the website and pattern library Creating the OpenActive brand The new brand direction is particularly key, and as the current extent of OpenActive’s visual identity consists of the Montserrat font and a set of blue/greys, we’ve started again from scratch. We want to establish a fully fledged brand to give the initiative the identity it deserves and elevate the expanding activity strands coming into fruition, such as the OpenActive Champions peer leadership network and the OpenActive Accelerator launching in May.",

This data can be made available for anyone to access, use, and share, helping consumers to discover and take part in new activities, and providers to more accurately tailor and grow their services. By encouraging organisations to publish their data openly and to a commonly agreed standard, we are not only facilitating open sharing across individual websites, but building a connected, online community that’s free to grow and innovate in response to its consumers’ needs.

Tables Are Cool col 3 is right-aligned $1600 col 2 is centered $12 zebra stripes are neat $1 There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don’t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown. Markdown Less Pretty Still renders nicely 1 2 3 Quotes Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote. Quote break. This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let’s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can put Markdown into a blockquote. Horizontal Rules Three or more… Hyphens Asterisks Underscores",

It is being coordinated by the Open Data Institute (ODI), an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organisation. Our goal is to make data on what, where and when physical activity sessions happen, openly available. This “opportunity data” includes details of a yoga class (“how much will it cost?”) through to badminton court availability (“where and when is a court available?”). [Read More]( /openactive/our-misson-full/){: .primary_cta} Section Notes Purpose: Functionality: Design: Copy-writing Notes: What Is Open Active? We are bringing together sports and physical activity organisations from across the sector to open up their opportunity data, from leisure operators to National Governing Bodies, local sports clubs to event providers, walking groups to fitness instructors. We are also helping other organisations to use this opportunity data to build interesting tools and experiences for consumers. We support organisations to: Open up data – helping them to share and publish data with an open licence. Innovate with data – helping them to use opportunity data to engage their audience. Learn about data – providing ODI-certified training to ensure organisations understand what open data is and how publishing data can benefit them. Create data standards – collaborating to create common standards for consistent, reliable data, which fuels innovation. Build momentum – spreading the message within the sector, and contributing to supporting materials that anyone can use. The OpenActive community was started by a group of enthusiastic sports and physical activity organisations who wanted to reach new audiences with better opportunities to get active, using data and smart technology. The ODI is calling on all organisations interested in using opportunity data to get more people active, to join the community.
