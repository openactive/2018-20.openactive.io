Craig is part of the sport & physical activity development team, I lead on the development and implementation of the Bristol Sport Facility Strategy, Bristol Playing Pitch Strategy and Bristol Sport4Life Strategy.

> The strategy work we have undertaken in Bristol has created and “uncovered” a vast amount of Bristol sport data. Bristol already has an active data and open data scene- I want to link the two and realise the opportunities available for local sport and physical activity participation.

> I really like the idea of using open data to improve the participation experience for specific user groups. The potential to develop an App focussed on, for example, older people, disabled people or people visiting the city. That concept is very exciting!
