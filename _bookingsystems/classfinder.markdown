Class Finder is designed specifically for fitness instructors to list their group exercise classes. Listing your classes on Class Finder automatically includes them in the Class Finder search and you can also choose to share your classes as open data.

 

If you are an individual instructor you can go straight to [Class Finder](https://www.classfinder.org.uk/) and register. If you represent a group exercise organisation you can [email us](mailto: insight@emduk.org) to discuss other options.
