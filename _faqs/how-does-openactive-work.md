OpenActive is a community-led initiative using open data to help people get active. We are working collaboratively to bring about change within the sector by:

* Improving access to ‘open opportunity data’. This means making data about where and when sport and physical activities happen open for anyone to access, use and share. By doing this, more places, products and services can better inform people of opportunities to get active.
* Stimulating innovation with data to help meet people’s digital expectations. We are running a 6-month-long startup accelerator. These startups, and other organisations, are creating products and services that use open data, in order to transform the way people discover and participate in relevant activities.
* Developing open standards. Our W3C group works collaboratively to decide how data about sport and physical activity opportunities can be described, categorised and structured in a consistent way. The standards aim to maximise use and compatibility for new tools, products, and services designed to get people active.
* Building data literacy within the sector. We champion data leadership, inspire transformation and change across organisations, and strengthen the practical capability of sport and physical activity organisations to work with open data
