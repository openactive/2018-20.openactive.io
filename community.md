### OpenActive Champions

OpenActive Champions is a programme of masterclasses, designed to encourage peer-to-peer problem solving and networking that supports the work of people already using data to transform the sector. The programme supports individuals and organisations working to innovate within their areas, and use data to help people get more active.

The ODI is connecting Champions to experts, and supporting them to develop new solutions, skills, and approaches to increase the impact of the work they undertake locally.
