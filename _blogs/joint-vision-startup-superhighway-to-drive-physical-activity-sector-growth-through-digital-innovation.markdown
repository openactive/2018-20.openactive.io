Leaders from the sport, fitness and technology sectors have unveiled a dynamic new collaboration to stimulate growth for digital startups that help people get active.

With a lack of adequate physical activity being one of Britain’s biggest public health challenges, London Sport, the Open Data Institute and ukactive have a collective vision to stimulate growth for digital startups that help people get active.

Together we are proactively progressing a more active future where startups — the innovators of tomorrow — have a clear trajectory towards physical activity innovation.

We’re progressing in unison three distinct and complementary digital innovation programmes run by London Sport, the Open Data Institute and ukactive, and supported by Sport England, to create a startup superhighway for physical activity innovators.

Our joint vision comes at a pivotal time for the sport and physical activity sector. We believe that startups play a central role in this vision.

Developments in data, social media, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and wearable technology are having a huge impact on the physical activity landscape. Digital products and services are moving into every part of people’s lives but we still have a large challenge ahead to ensure the benefits of widespread digital innovation lead to increased physical activity.

Our ambition: Creating a collaborative network of expertise to maximise positive outcomes for physical activity
We are shifting the way startup innovation is unlocked to drive physical activity. Historically in other sectors, startup innovation has been progressed in organisational silos led by one-track-minded objectives. We believe more can be achieved when we enrich innovation together as a sector and invite others to consider how their innovation priorities can contribute to sector transformation.

The sport and physical activity sector are in a unique position to learn from past approaches and provide a broad and inclusive support system for startups by working to compliment what already exists in the sector.

Collectively, we recognise with our wealth of specialist expertise and resources available across our individual startup programmes, we can nurture the rich startup ecosystem in the UK. Our startup programmes will augment new developments in digital innovation, data and technology to produce pioneering solutions for the global physical activity crisis — which in the UK alone costs £20bn each year and causes 37,000 deaths.

Our joint approach serves as a launchpad for talented tech startups aspiring to get people moving. We are presenting a breeding ground of innovation for physical activity organisations, where they can refer and refine promising ideas into scalable solutions through a pathway of focused accelerators.

The startups we support will develop solutions beyond just apps. They will harness technological innovation in its broadest sense through digital products and services, and applying the latest technology to reshape how people become and stay active. For example, we hope to see data used to better integrate physical activities into local services, create more immersive outdoor fitness experiences using augmented reality, or wearable technology tools that monitor physical health and support GPs with earlier patient intervention. With a holistic approach to digital and technological innovation, the opportunities are endless.

### An integrated approach to support startups at every stage of development

Our joint vision aims to prioritise the creation of the most promising solutions to evolve how people get and stay active, working beyond the established ‘scale-up or die quickly’ approach.

This strategy allows an integrated pathway of progression for startups at every phase of development — from early stage concept through to scale-up and expansion — with mentoring, workshops and access to investors. They have the freedom to choose a network of optional routes available to progress their vision into reality.

### About the startup programmes

The Sport Tech Hub incubator led by London Sport provides an entry point for startups, nurturing the brightest early-stage startups focused on raising levels of participation in sport with a programme of support delivered by industry experts. The inaugural programme kicked off in October 2017 and will run for six months, with applications for a second incubation cohort opening to new startups in mid-2018.

The Open Data Institute’s OpenActive Accelerator, supports startups using open data to develop and validate ready-to-market digital products and services that make it easier for people to be regularly active. The first OpenActive Accelerator launches in May 2018 and will run for six months.

Finally, ukactive’s growth programme for digital startups — ActiveLab — will cater for businesses who are now focusing on growth and scale at home and internationally, having already validated their product and generated revenue. ActiveLab was launched in September 2016 and this year returns for a second instalment, running for three months from March 2018.

### A superhighway for success

Prospective startups have the opportunity to apply to whichever programme matches their stage of growth best and can choose to subsequently apply to other programmes we offer should they wish. This will ensure that physical activity startups have a stream of opportunities to access the programmes best-suited to their growth needs.
